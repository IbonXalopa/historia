# historia
Historia is a web based application to support large research projects for historians and other humanities researchers.

## Starting Historia
Historia uses a built-in web server, and currently has no configuration (something that will change soon). To start the web server on a local machine simply browse to the historia/src folder in a command line window and run ./historia.  Then in your web browser open: http://localhost:8080/historia

## Requirements
**Python 3.4**
Historia's back end is pure python and so should run on any platform that supports Python 3.4 or later, but it has only been tested on MacOS X.
